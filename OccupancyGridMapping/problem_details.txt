For the poses and measurements included in the .mat file below, use the occupancy grid mapping techniques of chapter 9 (table 9.1 and 9.2) 
to create a map of the environment. You can assume the environment is well represented by a 100 m by 100 m grid where cells are 1 m square.

The state_meas_data.mat file includes three variables:

X: state vector holding (x, y, theta) at each time step
z: measurement vector holding (range, bearing) for nine laser range finder measurements at each time step. 
    NaN is reported if a "hit" is not detected.
thk: vector of nine range finder pointing angles ranging between -pi/2 (-90 deg) and pi/2 (90 deg). 
    Pointing angles are equally spaced at pi/8 rad (22.5 deg) of separation. 
Use the following parameters for your inverse range sensor model: alpha = 1 m, beta = 5 deg, z_max = 150 m.

Use p(m_i)  = occupied be 0.6 to 0.7 if a "hit" is detected and 0.3 to 0.4 for p(m_i) = occupied if a "hit" is not detected for a particular cell.
